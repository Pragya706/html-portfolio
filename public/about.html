<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi! I’m Pragya, an undergraduate student currently pursuing a B.Tech in Computer Science at Ramaiah University. 
  I have a deep passion for coding and love diving into new projects that challenge my skills.
   When I'm not coding, you can find me enjoying outdoor activities, whether it's hiking, camping, or just exploring nature.
    My experience as an NCC cadet in 10th standard taught me valuable lessons in discipline and teamwork, 
    which I carry with me in my studies and personal life. 
    I’m always eager to learn new things and push my boundaries, both academically and personally!

</p>

<p> I have a solid foundation in several programming languages, including Java, Python, C, HTML, CSS and MySql. 
  Academically, I scored an impressive 83 percentile in 10th grade and 84 percentile in 12th grade, 
  and I've maintained a strong academic record with a 9.1 CGPA in my first year and over 9 in my second year.</p>
